Worked with others on a car sensor as my first project in OAMK.
The car sensor had its own sound emitter as well as led lights
to show when the sensor was getting close to a wall. This project
was done using Arduino.

# Current Project

a Mobile game that has different functions such as gravity, 
projectile shooting and general level design elements.
